# Student Academic Performance Analysis System

GSE301 Data Science: Python Fundamentals

A comprehensive Python application that stores, processes, and analyzes mock academic data for students in a department.

## Project Overview

This system demonstrates fundamental Python concepts including:

- Data types and structures (list, dictionary, set, tuple)
- Conditional statements (if/elif/else, match/case)
- Type conversion and validation
- Error handling (try/except)
- List operations and slicing
- Set operations
- Logical operators
- Interactive menu systems

## Features

### Part 1: Data Collection and Storage

- ✅ Variable declaration with different data types
- ✅ Student data stored in lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples
- ✅ Sample data for 5 students pre-loaded

### Part 2: Data Processing and Logic

- ✅ Grading function using if/elif/else statements
- ✅ Grade feedback using match/case
- ✅ Type conversion and validation with error handling

### Part 3: Analysis and Reporting

- ✅ List operations and slicing demonstrations
- ✅ Set operations (intersection, union, difference)

### Part 4: Interactive Menu System

- ✅ Console menu with match/case
- ✅ View all students
- ✅ Add new student
- ✅ Check graduation eligibility
- ✅ Find top performer

### Part 5: Advanced Challenges

- ✅ Nested data processing (average scores calculation)
- ✅ Pattern matching with match/case

## Requirements Checklist

- ✅ Meaningful variable names using snake_case
- ✅ Use of list, tuple, dictionary, and set
- ✅ Demonstration of type casting
- ✅ IF ELIF ELSE logic
- ✅ MATCH CASE used multiple times
- ✅ Try Except implemented
- ✅ List slicing demonstrated
- ✅ Set operations shown
- ✅ Logical operators used
- ✅ Comments explaining major steps

## Installation

No external dependencies required! This project uses only Python standard library.

```bash
# Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed (for match/case support)
python3 --version

# Run the program
python3 student_analysis.py
```

## Usage

1. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python3 student_analysis.py
   ```

2. The program will demonstrate key features first, then show the interactive menu.

3. Use the menu options:
   - **1**: View all students in the system
   - **2**: Add a new student with validation
   - **3**: Check if a student is eligible for graduation
   - **4**: Find the student with the highest CGPA
   - **5**: Exit the system

## Sample Output

```sh
============================================
     Student Academic Performance System
============================================
Loading student records...
5 student profiles loaded successfully.

--------------------------------------------
Menu Options
1. View all students

## Code Features

### Clean and Beginner-Friendly

- Well-commented code explaining each section
- Clear function names and variable names
- Organized into logical sections
- Error handling for user input
- Helpful messages and feedback

### Key Python Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Data Types**: String, int, float, bool, list, dict, set, tuple
2. **Conditionals**: if/elif/else for grading logic
3. **Match/Case**: Modern Python pattern matching
4. **Type Conversion**: String to int/float with validation
5. **Error Handling**: Try/except blocks for robust input
6. **List Slicing**: Top 3, last 5, every other element
7. **Set Operations**: Intersection, union, difference
8. **Logical Operators**: and, or for eligibility checks
9. **Functions**: Modular, reusable code
10. **Dictionaries**: Nested data structures for student profiles
